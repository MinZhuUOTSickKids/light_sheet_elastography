Pattern-guided_Cell_Motion_Tracking.py 
The software allows the selection of a working area to track the average motion. It then tracks selected points within the working area by comparing small areas around each point over time. The points themselves and size of the areas around the points to be tracked are user selectable. The output is the positions of the selected points at each time point.
